This directory contains the implementation of the Genodians management
component. It is used to manage the various sub-systems of the appliance
like the web-server and import mechanism by monitoring the state of each
sub-init and producing sub-init configurations.


Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The manager can be configured by the following attributes in the
'config' node:

* :status_update_interval_sec: sets the time interval in seconds in
  which the status page is updated.

The resources of the various sub-systems can be configured by their
corresponding node in the configuration.

The 'lighttpd' node also features the following valid attributes:

* :ram: sets the initial ram quota.

* :caps: sets the initial cap quota.

* :heartbeat_ms: sets the time interval for heartbeat checks in
  milliseconds.

The 'import' node has the following attributes:

* :update_interval_min: sets the time interval in minutes that the
                        import mechanism waits between updates.

* :heartbeat_ms: sets the time interval for heartbeat checks in
                 milliseconds.

It also contains a list of steps that are performed in a fixed order
where each of them features the following attributes:

* :ram: sets the initial ram quota.

* :caps: sets the initial cap quota.

The following list shows the fixed order and describes each step:

* :fetchurl: downloads the archive file of every author.

* :wipe: removes all files from the file system targeted by the
         following step.

* :extract: extracts all downloaded archives.

* :generate: generates the actual website from the files extracted
             in the previous step.

The configuration of each step is provided by a ROM named after
the step, e.g. 'fetchurl.config', and generated at build-time.

The following exemplary configuration illustrates how the manager is
currently integrated:

!<start name="genodians_manager" caps="100">
!  <resource name="RAM" quantum="8M"/>
!  <config status_update_interval_sec="60">
!    <lighttpd ram="64M" caps="300" heartbeat_ms="5000"/>
!    <import update_interval_min="180" heartbeat_ms="3000">
!      <fetchurl ram="48M" caps="300"/>
!      <wipe     ram="48M" caps="1000"/>
!      <extract  ram="48M" caps="300"/>
!      <generate ram="64M" caps="1500"/>
!    </import>
!  </config>
